                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Khuselo Sofohlo, a dedicated and ambitious Computer Science student at Wits University with a passion for problem-solving, software development, and artificial intelligence. Originally from Kanana in Lusikisiki, I have always been driven by curiosity and a strong work ethic, which has led me to excel academically, earning six distinctions in my first year. Beyond academics, I am actively involved in leadership and mentorship as a First Year Experience Mentor and the Maintenance & Welfare Officer of my residence's House Committee. I also balance my time with fitness, skating, and volunteering as an usher at my church. With strong analytical and leadership skills, I aim to make an impact in the tech industry while continuously growing and learning.</p>

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>My latest project involved developing an AI for a competitive snake game, where the agent navigates obstacles, avoids zombies, and makes strategic decisions to survive and grow. The AI had to balance pursuing apples with self-preservation while adapting to dynamic game conditions. This project strengthened my skills in pathfinding, game theory, and AI decision-making.</p>
