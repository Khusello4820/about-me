Since Git comes preinstalled in some Linux-based systems, I cheched if there is a Git by typing git version in the terminal.
I connected my my GITHUB account to my Git account.
I created and edited my code files locally using visual studio code.
I created a new repository called  "about me" on the Github website, with the description Lab 1 Software Design and made it public.

I ran these commands on my visual studio code terminal.

echo "# sample-code" >> README.md

git init

git add index.html

git commit -m "first file index.html"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/Khusello4820/about-me.git

git push -u origin main
